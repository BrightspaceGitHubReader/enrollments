# enrollments

Web components to be used with `enrollments` entities!

`master` contains Polymer 3 entities which can be used with an enrollment entity from the Brightspace Hypermedia APIs.

`hybrid` contains Polymer 1/2 hybrid entities for use with the same entities. With time, this branch will eventually see less usage, as we come to support the newer versions of Polymer, and move things over. For now, though, most elements and changes will be present in this branch.
